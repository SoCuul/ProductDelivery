# Deprecation Notice
As of September 2022, this project has been abandoned. I would not reccomend using the codebase for your personal bot, as it is not very resilient and may have bugs.
The purchase hub (in roblox) was never completed either, which makes this bot not very useful.
No support will be provided for any self-hosted use of this bot.
